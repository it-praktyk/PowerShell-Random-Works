IDEAS 
- checking github website for updated xlm files and downloading it locally
- checking local folder or remote share for previously downloaded hotfixes and download only missed (MD5/SHA1 sum needed ?)
- add decompress option for downloaded hotfixes
- output report to file / with diferent format support
- add support for another systems and roles e.g. file services

Some ideas implementent in Unstable branch
